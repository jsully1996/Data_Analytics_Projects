    "# Association of Crime with Cultural Spaces\n",
    "### Another popular dataset found in the City of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue is one that lists the cultural spaces in the city. With a total of 388, each of these cultural spaces belong to one of the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Museum/Gallery\n",
    "* Studio/Rehearsal \n",
    "* Community Space\n",
    "* Educational\n",
    "* Theatre/Performance\n",
    "* Cafe/Restaurant/Bar\n",
    "* Other\n",
    "\n",
    " In this particular notebook, we attempt to undertake an analysis of crime that occurs with respect to city cultural spaces - in other words, we want to understand the correlation of lanes with crime in the city. This can help us answer popular questions such as:\n",
    "* Is there a prevalence of crime near cultural spaces?\n",
    "* Is any particular type of cultural space associated with more/less crime?\n",
    " and so on. Such observations are useful to a variety of entities. In the most obvious context, it helps law enforcement agencies concentrate their efforts in these particular spaces and also alerts residents of potential dangers that might occur in their vicinity. Let us proceed in our analysis step-by-step. First we must import the necessary dependencies."
