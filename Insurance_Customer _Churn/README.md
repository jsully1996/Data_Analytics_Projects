# Retaining Insurance customers with Churn Prediction
The essence of this project is to showcase an application for a predictive model while at the same time learning the basics of data ETL, pipelines and machine learning with <a href='https://www.h2o.ai/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=machine%20learning&utm_campaign=ml&gclid=CjwKCAjwx9_4BRAHEiwApAt0zhoKsW3UFygiJN6hCCdQZOGC3tDtof0gVla0ns8wfPbctTYatUrAORoCOMcQAvD_BwE'>H2O</a>, Apache Spark and Flask.

## Concept
Customers are said to "Churn" when they stop using a company's product or services. In this particular use case, we refer to customer churn as the percentage of people that do not renew their insurance policy after it expires its term. A great many factors may contribute to a customer's decision to purchase insurance again. The ability to predict whether a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, avoids a direct loss of revenue for a business. It is usually more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer. Take a look at this [tutorial](Churn_tutorials/Basic_churn_prediction.ipynb) to see how a basic RandomForest model with sklearn and python can make predictions about customer churn.
